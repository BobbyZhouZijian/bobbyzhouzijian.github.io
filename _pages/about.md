# Zijian ZHOU  
*PhD Student, School of Computing, National University of Singapore*

I am a second-year PhD candidate advised by **Bryan Kian Hsiang Low** at NUS.  
My research explores the theory and practice of **data-centric machine learning**, with a recent focus on *large language models (LLMs)*, *statistical learning*, and *multi-agent machine learning*.  
I am particularly interested in how we can **value, curate, and attribute data** to make modern ML systems more reliable, fair, and efficient.
